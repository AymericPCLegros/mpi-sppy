GAMS debug starting Dec 15, 2023

for Iter0, once in a blue moon everything is OK, but most times the objectives
are all OK but some of the scens (or sometimes just one of them)
have 6.426 E246 for the level of the third nonant even though the obj is
correct.  Other times all three scenarios have bad levels for the third var.
The bad levels obviously cause a lot of trouble.

sleeps do not seem to help

see /home/woodruff/software/gams45.3_linux_x64_64_sfx/api/python/examples/control/benders_2stage.py

Iter1 solves fail (I think always, but I can't get iter0 to succeed
again to check) with a status of 6

Dec 31, 2023
Iter0 now works and I can recover the levels by using sync_db

Iter1 is failing with code of 19, which means total disaster

See farmer_linear_augmented.py

****************************************************8
after all these struggles, it turns out that I just needed a bound
on the penalty variable. I should have used output=sys.stdout on
the solve call sooner!!
