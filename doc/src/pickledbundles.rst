Pickled Bundles
===============

At the time of this writing, pickled bundles is a little bit beyond the bleeding edge.
The idea is that bundles are formed and then saved as dill pickle files for rapid retrieval,
which is mainly useful for algorithm tuning and algorithm experimentation at this time. The file ``aircond_cylinders.py``
in the aircond example directory provides an example.  The latter part of the ``allways.bash`` script
demonstrates how to run it.

In the future, we plan to support this concept with higher levels of abstraction.
